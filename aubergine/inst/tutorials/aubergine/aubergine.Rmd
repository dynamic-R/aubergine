## About the authors (Thomas and Karline)

```{r background, echo=FALSE}

 correct = "We are both biologists with a passion for mathematics; Thomas is a limnologist, Karline is a marine biologist. After her master in biology, Karline also studied computer sciences.",

```{r Model_types, echo=FALSE}
question("Which type of models do we typically use?", type = "learnr_checkbox",
 answer("Mechanistic models", correct=TRUE),
 answer("Statistical models"),
 answer("Black-box models"),
 answer("Qualitative models"),
 correct = "We develop mechanistic models that start from principles of physics, chemistry,
biology, ecology, and that are mathematically composed of differential equations. They are so-called
“engineering type of models”, aiming to advance our understanding of natural systems and that allow
prediction of these systems under various scenarios.",

```{r why_modelling, echo=FALSE}
question("Why do we develop mechanistic models?", type = "learnr_checkbox",
answer("they allow us to test our understanding of real systems", correct=TRUE),
answer("they allow us to extrapolate to larger spatial and temporal scales", correct=TRUE),
answer("they can guide empirical research", correct=TRUE),
answer("they allow us to invalidate empirical research", correct=FALSE),
answer("they allow us to test hypotheses", correct=FALSE),
answer("they allow us to generate hypotheses", correct=TRUE),
answer("because it is a lot of fun", correct=FALSE),

incorrect = "Modelling IS a lot of fun, but this is not our primary goal - we use models in addition to data gathering because it gives a different perspective of reality, it increases our understanding, allows to extrapolate, it may guide our research and may be used to generate hypotheses",

```{r programming_platform, echo=FALSE}

answer("Rstudio"),
answer("Rmarkdown"),
answer("R", correct=TRUE),
answer("Matlab"),
answer("Python"),
answer("deSolve"),
incorrect = "In this list, only R, matlab and python are programming languages, and R is the one that we use. Rmarkdown is a platform to merge R-code with text;  Rstudio provides an interface that facilitates using R; deSolve is one of the many R-packages that we use",

```{r why_R, echo=FALSE}
question("Why do we use R?", type = "learnr_checkbox",
answer("it is faster than matlab or python"),
answer("it is as good as matlab or python", correct= TRUE),
answer("it is very well suited for post-processing", correct=TRUE),
answer("it is an open-source community project", correct=TRUE),
answer("the solvers have been optimised for mechanistic modeling", correct=TRUE),
answer("it is easy to share models made in R", correct=TRUE),
answer("we can run complex 3-D applications in R", correct=FALSE),

incorrect = "We started using R around 2005-2010 because we thought it had potential, it was open-source, and supported by a growing community of R enthousiasts. Since then we created tools in R to make it suitable for our type of work. Even after all this time, R is still the best language to apply our type of models - it is ideal for teaching environmental modeling, as well as for more 'serious' scientific work. For the really complex models however, we resort to dedicated software, written in compiled code",
