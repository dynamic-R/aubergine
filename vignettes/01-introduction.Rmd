## Tutorial

This tutorial was developed as didactic resource for the
\href{https://aquaticdatasciopensci.github.io/}{AEMON-J} workshop 
in 2021. We aim to develop this package further after the workshop, so your 
feedback is welcome.

We recommend to 

* watch the introductory video first: https://youtu.be/L_zL_D1Qmjc

* If you prefer reading, you can find the slides under [this
link](https://dynamic-r.github.io/hacking-limnology/).

Then you can go through the tutorials. They are included in two versions:

* Intereactive tutorials using the **learnr** package. They can be run in RStudio
  or placed on a "shiny" server.
* Static versions of the tutorials as package vignettes. The tutorials can
  be read with any R Gui (including but not limited to RStudio) and also read
  online with a web browser. Direct access to RMarkdown and R source code is 
  provided in the help index of the package.
  
## The name of the package

We tried to find a package name and had lots of fun with different ideas. Then
we considered to call it after a vegetable and choose "aubergine". It had no
special reason, but we can of course give a post-hoc explanation:

An aubergine (*Solanum melongena**), also called "eggplant" is a very atractive 
fruit. It is not edible in raw form, 
" but it becomes tender when cooked and develops a rich, complex flavor. Rinsing, draining, and salting the sliced fruit before cooking may remove the bitterness.[37] The fruit is capable of absorbing cooking fats and sauces, which may enhance the flavor of eggplant dishes." [@wikipedia_eggplant, @bbc_eggplant]
