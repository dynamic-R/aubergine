**Technical Note** regarding compilation of this document:

* Please run this in a folder with write access, the document will create several 100 files.
* Due to simulations, compilation may take a minute or more.
* At the end, you can easily delete all temporary river*.png files.

## A Goody at the End: Easy Parallel Execution with `future`

We have seen that computation of 1D models can take a while, and if we go through the script line by
line, we may consider to wait before we enter the next part. Here we can ask: Why not running the simulation in the background or Why not running the three scenarios in parallel on our multiprocessor machine? 

This is indeed possible and R has different mechanisms for this, one intriguingly 
simple is provided by package **future** [@Bengtsson2020]. In the following, we 
just use the `%<-%` operator instead of the common `<-`.

Before that, we set a `plan` that **R** should run this in multiple sessions.

How does it work? After entering sich a code segment, R gives control back to the user,
and starts simulation in a separate R worker process in the background.
This can then be done for all three scenarios one after each other, because its results (`std0` ... `std2`) are not yet needed for the next step. They are eventually needed "in the future" for the `plot` function, so R does not need to return the results immediately.

The following code is again a simple 1D river model, solved with packages **deSolve** [@Soetaert2010a] and **ReacTran** [@Soetaert2012ReacTran].

### The model

```{r river-npz}
library(ReacTran)

riverNPZ <- function(time, y, parms) {
  with(as.list(parms), {
    N <- y[       1  :   nbox ]
    P <- y[(  nbox+1):(2*nbox)]
    Z <- y[(2*nbox+1):(3*nbox)]

    p_growth  <- r_pgrow * N / (km_n + N) * P
    z_grazing <- r_zgraz * P / (km_p + P) * Z
    z_loss    <- r_zloss * Z

    n_transport <- tran.1D(C=N, C.up=N.up, v=v, dx=Grid)
    p_transport <- tran.1D(C=P, C.up=P.up, v=v, dx=Grid)
    z_transport <- tran.1D(C=Z, C.up=Z.up, v=v, dx=Grid)

    n_import <- n_transport$flux.up   # in [mmol/m2/d]
    n_export <- n_transport$flux.down

    dN_dt <- c_pn * (-p_growth + (1-asseff) * z_grazing + z_loss) + n_transport$dC
    dP_dt <-         p_growth -               z_grazing           + p_transport$dC
    dZ_dt <-                  +     asseff *  z_grazing - z_loss  + z_transport$dC

    list(c(dN_dt, dP_dt, dZ_dt),
         n_import=n_import, n_export=n_export,
         meanN=mean(N), meanP=mean(P), meanZ=mean(Z))
  })
}
parms <- c(
  r_pgrow    = 0.5,   # phytoplankton growth parameter (1/d)
  r_zgraz    = 0.4,   # zooplankton ingestion parameter (1/d)
  r_zloss    = 0.01,  # zooplankton loss parameter (1/d)

  km_n       = 0.5,   # Monod constant of phyto growth on nutrient (mmol/m3)
  km_p       = 100,   # Monod constant of zoo grazing on phyto (mmol/m3)
  c_pn       = 1/106, # stoichiometric conversion from phosporus P to phyto C (P:C)
  asseff     = 0.3,   # assimilation efficiency of zoo (-)

  v          = 10000, # flow velocity (m/d)
  N.up       = 500,   # nutrient (PO4) in inflow (mmolP/m3)
  P.up       = 10,    # algae in inflow (mmolC/m3)
  Z.up       = 1      # zooplankton in inflow (mmolC/m3)
)

# river morphology
Length <- 500e3  # length of the river (m)
nbox   <- 500    # number of 1D grid cells
Grid   <- setup.grid.1D(L = Length, N = nbox)

# Zoo and Phyto as C and Phosphorus P (mol/m3)
N_init  <- rep(500, times=nbox) # mmolP/m3
P_init  <- rep(100, times=nbox) # mmolC/m3
Z_init  <- rep(10,  times=nbox) # mmolC/m3
y_init  <- c(N_init, P_init, Z_init)
```

### Parallelization

```{r river-npz-future, fig.height=8, fig.width=8}
library("future")

parms1 <- parms2 <- parms
system.time({
  plan(strategy="multisession")
  #plan(strategy="sequential")
  
  ## three staions for the equilibrium (=stationary state)
  parms["v"] <- 1000  # (m/d)
  std0 %<-% steady.1D(y=y_init, time=0, func=riverNPZ, parms=parms,
                       nspec=3, names=c("N","P","Z"), method="runsteady")
  
  parms1["v"] <- 5000  # m/d
  std1 %<-% steady.1D(y=y_init, time=0, func=riverNPZ, parms=parms1,
                       nspec=3, names=c("N","P","Z"), method="runsteady")
  
  parms2["v"] <- 10000 # m/d
  std2 %<-% steady.1D(y=y_init, time=0, func=riverNPZ, parms=parms2,
                       nspec=3, names=c("N","P","Z"), method="runsteady")
  
  plot(std0, std1, std2, mfrow=c(3,1), grid=Grid$x.mid/1000, lty=1, lwd=2, xlab="km")
  
  ## and a dynamic simulation (= nonstationary)
  time_seq <- seq(from = 0, to = 200, length.out=201)
  dynamic  %<-% ode.1D(y=y_init, times=time_seq, func=riverNPZ, parms=parms, nspec=3)
})
```

The normal sequential version took 15s and the multisession version 6.5s on my PC with 4 (i5 with 4 cores).

Instead of parallelization, or in addition to it, it is also possible to make the model itself faster.
Typical means are vectorization (that is already the case for the river model), and
compiled code. Here the model is written in C or Fortran and then linked to R.
Depending on the type of the model and how good it can be vectorized, simulations
can then be 2 to 200 times faster, in particular if the model cannot be written
in matrix notation. The C or Fortran code can be written by hand or created
from a code generator. Here, manual programming is not that difficult, because
only the numerical parts need to be encoded. More about this can be found in the
[package vignettte](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/deSolve/vignettes/compiledCode.pdf)
of **deSolve** and in a 
[small tutorial](https://tpetzoldt.github.io/deSolve-compiled/deSolve-compiled.html) on Github.

The C or Fortran code can also be created with a code generator, e.g. **cOde** [@Kaschek2019] or
**odin** [@Fritzjohn2021]. Furthermore, package **rodeo** [@Kneis2017,@Kneis2021] can 
generate **deSolve** compatible Fortran code directly from a tabular description 
(stoichiometry table or Petersen-Gujer-matrix) of the model. It is also able to
generate code for 1D models.

## Visualization of multi-dimensional model results

Dynamic models are multi-dimensional. Let's say we have a 1D model as follows, we
have 3 dimensions (time, space, value) for each state variable. In such cases it makes
sense to use volor image graphics (also called [HovmÃ¶ller diagrams](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hovm%C3%B6ller_diagram))
or animations. 

### Color image diagram

Color image diagrams can be created with **R**'s `image` function. Some more options
are available in packages **plot3D** [@plot3D] and **OceanView** [@OceanView].

```{r river-npz-image, fig.height=8, fig.width=8}
image(dynamic, xlab = "time, days", ylab = "Distance, m", grid= Grid$x.mid,
      main =c("PO4","Phyto","Zoo"), add.contour=TRUE, mfrow = c(3, 1)) 
```

### Animated graphics

Here we want to create an animated figure. To make it well readable, we use 
filled polygons. First, a loop creates png images for each time step of the simulation
and then **gifski** [@Ooms2021] puts this together and creates a gif-file.

```{r river-npz-ani, fig.height=8, fig.width=8}
plot_poly <- function(data, time) {
  poly <- function(x, y, pcol, ylab, ylim) {
    plot(x, y, type="n", las=1, xlab="", ylab="", ylim=ylim)
    polygon(x, y, col=pcol, border=pcol, lty="blank")
    mtext(side=1, line=1.5, text="km")
    mtext(side=2, line=3.5, text=ylab, las=3)

  }
  y <- data[time, -1]
  N <- y[1:nbox]
  P <- y[(nbox+1):(2*nbox)]
  Z  <- y[(2*nbox+1):(3*nbox)]
  x   <- c(1, 1:nbox, nbox)
  #cat("time ", time, "\n")

  poly(x, c(0, N, 0), ylim=c(0,  1000), pcol="#a6cee3", ylab="P-PO4 (mmol/m3)")
  poly(x, c(0, P, 0), ylim=c(0, 70000), pcol="#b2df8a", ylab="Phyto (mmol/m3)")
  poly(x, c(0, Z, 0), ylim=c(0, 50000), pcol="#ee7f00", ylab="Zoo (mmol/m3)")
}

for (tt in time_seq)  {
  png(paste0("river", 1000 + tt, ".png"), width=800, height=600, pointsize = 18)
  par(mfrow=c(3,1))
  par(mar=c(3,5,.5,0), las=1, cex.axis=1.4, cex.lab=1.4, cex.main=2)
  plot_poly(dynamic, tt)
  dev.off()
}

library("gifski")
gifski(dir(pattern="^river.*png$"), gif_file = "river.gif", width=800, height=600, delay=1/25)
```
![](river.gif)

## Finally

Finally, we close the **future** workers and reset the strategy back to sequential.


```{r close-workers}
plan(strategy="sequential") # return to the default plan and close the workers
```
